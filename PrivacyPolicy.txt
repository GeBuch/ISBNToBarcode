The application "ISBN to Barcode" does not collect any data from users other than that which is gathered by third-party services.
List of services:
- Google Play Store (https://play.google.com/about/play-terms/ & https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en)
- Google ML Kit (https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms)
I don't use any data which is collected by these services.
